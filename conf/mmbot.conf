# is used to communicate with the command-line interface.
# 
# this file also used to detect, whether the bot is running, to
# support start/stop/restart and other features. You can run multiple
# instances where the each instance has different inst_file.
#
# if you delete instance file while the bot is running, you will 
# unable to control the service. You need to kill it manually
# using killall (or pidof mmbot and kill)
#

inst_file=../run/inst.pid

# Allows to change effective user. This is useful, when the bot

## note increasing count of threads doesn't speed up the main trading cycle.
#
http_threads=25

# path to the directory, where traders data are stored

storage_path=../data

# data are stored in binary format. You can disable binary format
# then data are stored as json. This makes large files, but readable
# for humans. Use this if you need to edit the data files.
#
# Note that you can edit data files only if the bot is stopped
 
# storage_binary=no

# specifies timeout in milliseconds for response from every broker. If the broker doesn't respond in time, it

[backtest]

## specifies size of backtest cache (in items). Default value is 8. 
## This allows to store data minute data or trades to run backtest, without need to reupload data
## for each attempt. The value specifies maximum number of data files stored on server. Once this
## value is reached, some old files are deleted, so data must be reuploaded later to run backtest again
## minimal value is 8
## note - cache can be temporary larger, because items are locked for 30sec after upload or use.
#
backtest_cache_size=30
#
## by default, cached items are stored in temporary folder. By enabling this option, the items will
## be stored in memory. This can increase total memory allocation
