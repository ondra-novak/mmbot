#  Defines brokers
#  
#  Each broker has a name and command line, which is executed during connection
#  to the broker
#
#  <name>=<command line> <args>
#
# The broker usually needs path to configuration file in secure_data. If the configuration file
# doesn't exists, it is created soon on later when the user sets the api keys. Without keys, the
# only public interface is available
#
# All directories are relative to this directory

## enable storage broker
## storage broker is used to put most of /data to external storage
## which can be for example a database
##
## note due to security reasons, the secure_data cannot be stored in database

# storage_broker=../bin/brokers/couchdb_storage -f couchdb_storage.conf

## set true to backup external storage locally at storage_path. This also
## helps to transfer local settings to the external storage

# backup_locally=true
